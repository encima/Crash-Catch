### Some Background

#### I bought a house out of sheer desperation 
#### The similiarites to [The Money Pit](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091541/) are striking
#### Strange things happened to my car shortly after moving in, so I bought some CCTV. Problem solved?

#HSLIDE

### Problem **NOT** Solved

* Rear Window Smashed
* Creepy child's scooter rolls out of the dark towards my (then) brand new car
* Wing mirrors cracked
* Some dude reverses into me and drives away

### You Will Need:

* A damaged car <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* A poor experience with the Police <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* A lonely life <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* CCTV so grainy that people believe it is a clip from the 1950s <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* OpenCV knowledge <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Python fun skills <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Step One 
#### Extract Your Video

<p>Your CCTV box is likely a large black hunk of Chinese excellence. Navigate the menus and find that extracting is difficult.</p>
<p>Film it on your phone and realise that you are filming at 4K a video being output to 1024*768 monitor</p>
<p>Navigate harder and see that you must first find the video name and then plug in a FAT USB. Do that and slap it into your PC with childish glee</p>

Result? Watch repeatedly and show people over and over

### Step Two
#### Crowdsource

<p>Slap the video on Twitter and see who helps</p>

Result? Some designers photoshop it but mostly people say no
